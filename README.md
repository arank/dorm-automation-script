dorm-automation-script
======================

A simple script to run on an old PC to link Hue Lights and Google API's so that they are automated and controllable via the web. This allows you to automate a morning alarm with a custom light show and voice sythesized greeting, as well as remotely play music, and control the lights via a website. This repo includes the simple python scripts as well as the code for the simple PHP website that allows for remote control. This was a quick hacked project to automate my dorm, so I apolagize for the aweful code quality and occasional profanity.
